NekOS is a Debian Based Linux distribution aimed to be user-friendly  
Like OpenSUSE and NIX, NekOS includes many features that facilitate tasks such as a graphical package manager, simple yet featureful settings application, development assistant and many more (FEATURES.md)  
NekOS isnt just a distro for the NekoExperience Desktop Environment, it includes many tweaks that make it a non standard yet debian compatible distro to keep the debian package compatibility (plus debian repositiories)  
many o those tweaks include custom NekOS apps built using the NTK, optional downloadable (opt-in) AI features (locally hosted), system level phone integration and some kernel patches (NekoKernel)
